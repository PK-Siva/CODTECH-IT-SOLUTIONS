OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project: MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISION Data Preprocessing and Model Evaluation Pipeline Project Overview This project provides a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed for data preprocessing and model evaluation. It facilitates seamless preprocessing of raw datasets, enabling users to quickly prepare their data for machine learning tasks. The pipeline handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, scales numerical features, and evaluates multiple models. Specifically, it supports classification tasks by training and evaluating two machine learning models:

Logistic Regression Random Forest Classifier The project is implemented in a Google Colab environment, allowing users to upload their dataset, preprocess it, and evaluate model performance in an easy-to-use interface.

Key Features Automated Data Upload:

Users can upload a CSV file directly through Google Colab's interface. Data Cleaning: Missing values are imputed for numerical features using the mean and for categorical features using the mode. One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical variables into binary features using One-Hot Encoding. Feature Scaling: Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity across features. Model Training and Evaluation: The pipeline trains and evaluates two classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) using common classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Performance Reporting: Detailed evaluation metrics are printed to compare the performance of different models. Workflow Dataset Upload: Upload your dataset in CSV format using Google Colab's upload feature. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, and any leading/trailing spaces in column names are removed.

Missing values are handled by imputing numerical columns with the mean and categorical columns with the most frequent value. Categorical variables are encoded using One-Hot Encoding. Numerical features are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into features (X) and target (y), and further split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).

Model Training and Evaluation: Logistic Regression and Random Forest models are trained using the training set. Models are evaluated on the test set, and performance is reported using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results are printed for each model for comparison.

Libraries Used Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing. Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation. Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for easy data upload and execution. Logistic Regression: A linear model for classification tasks. Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model for classification. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score. Usage Instructions Upload Dataset: Click the "Upload" button in Google Colab to upload a CSV file containing your dataset. Run the Pipeline: Execute the script to perform preprocessing, train the models, and evaluate their performance. View Results: Review the printed evaluation metrics for both models to assess their performance. Example Output: After running the code, the output is:
